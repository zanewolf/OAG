He supervises the research and academic program of graduate students studying oceanographic engineering through the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in the areas of control, robotics, and design.  Dr. Yoerger has been a key contributor to the remotely-operated vehicle Jason; to the Autonomous Benthic Explorer known as ABE; most recently, to the autonomous underwater vehicle, Sentry; and the hybrid remotely operated vehicle, Nereus which reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in 2009.  Dr. Yoerger has gone to sea on over 80 oceanographic expeditions exploring the Mid-Ocean Ridge, mapping underwater seamounts and volcanoes, surveying ancient and modern shipwrecks, studying the environmental effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the recent effort that located the Voyage Data Recorder from the merchant vessel El Faro. His current research focuses on robots for exploring the midwater regions of the world's ocean. He heads a team developing a new underwater robot called Mesobot designed to track midwater targets such as zooplankton that play an important role in the movement of carbon through the world’s oceans. He was the 2009 recipient of the Lockheed Award for Ocean Science and Engineering and serves on the Research Board for BP's Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative. He recently served as interim Director of WHOI's Center for Marine Robotics and recently held the Walter A. and Hope Noyes Smith Chair for Excellence in Oceanography. He was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 2021 for the development of autonomous underwater vehicles for deep-ocean exploration and science.","slug":"danayoeger"},"id":"36cfc0c3-9cfc-5946-bc6c-9c33e9242e3e"},{"data":{"Name":"Dave Matthews","Research_Keywords":"evolution,fish,biomechanics,plasticity,zebrafish","Personal_Keywords":"volleyball,photography,climbing\n","Image":"https://oeb.harvard.edu/files/oeb/files/dave_matthews.jpg?m=1498229481","Email":"davethescientist@gmail.com","Affiliations":"Harvard University","Title":"Graduate Student","Website":"http://davethescientist.com/","Primary_Field":"Policy/Economics","Secondary_Fields":"Biomechanic Plasticity","About":"Ph.D. student in George Lauder's lab.

By developing novel imaging and illumination tools (e.g., DeepPIV and EyeRIS), automating the classification of underwater visual data using artificial intelligence (FathomNet), and integrating algorithms on vehicles (ML-Tracking) for robotic vehicle missions (e.g., Mesobot, LRAUV) to consistently and persistently observe ocean life, their efforts will increase access to biology and related phenomena in the deep sea. If successful, the Bioinspiration Lab hopes to spark collaborative research and engineering innovations inspired by poorly understood inhabitants living in the least explored habitat on our planet.","slug":"kakanikatija"},"id":"d77fdc6a-df2e-5189-a940-f614b8705d0d"},{"data":{"Name":"Peter Girguis","Research_Keywords":"hydrothermal vents, tube worms, bioluminescence","Personal_Keywords":"hockey,pinball,soccer,softball\n","Image":"https://asm.org/ASM/media/Biographies/COMs/2020-2021/Peter-Girguis.jpg?ext=.jpg","Email":"pgirguis@oeb.harvard.edu","Affiliations":"Harvard University, WHOI","Title":"Professor","Website":null,"Primary_Field":"Biological Sciences","Secondary_Fields":"Deep Sea Biogeochemistry","About":"Peter Girguis is a Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. He studies the physiological and biochemical adaptations of marine animals and microbes to their environment, their role in biogeochemical cycles, and their responses to a changing world. He is especially interested in animal-microbial partnerships, from the microbe-animal symbioses at hydrothermal vents to the gut microbiomes of baleen whales. He also develops novel “open-access” instruments such as underwater mass spectrometers and microbial samplers, with the goal of enabling all stakeholders to have access to such tools. Professor Girguis received his B.Sc. from UCLA, his Ph.D. from the UC Santa Barbara, and was a Packard Postdoctoral Fellow at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. He joined the Harvard University faculty in 2005. He was a Distinguished Lecturer for the NSF RIDGE2000 initiative, a Merck Co. Innovative Research Awardee, and chair of the National Deep Submergence Science Committee. He serves on several notable boards, including the Ocean Exploration Trust and the Schmidt Ocean Institute. He has authored or co-authored over 90 publications, and his honors include the 2007 and 2011 Lindbergh Foundation Award for Science & Sustainability, the 2018 Lowell Thomas Award for groundbreaking advances in Marine Science and Technology, and the 2020 Petra Shattuck Award for Distinguished Teaching. He was recently named a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator for his research on marine symbioses.
