I seek to understand the fundamental “rules” of community composition and how human activities are changing these rules in marine ecosystems. I’m particularly interested in the ways that benthic community composition is determined by the interplay of reproductive life histories, dispersal, recruitment, and environmental conditions. I also examine the ways that metabolites evolve in marine organisms and how they shape competitive hierarchies on the seafloor (e.g., secondary metabolites). I received a Ph.D. in Marine Biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California San Diego, an M.S. in Oceanography from SIO, and a B.S. in Biology from the University of Vermont. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and San Diego State University, and I am currently a Lecturer and Researcher in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. As the Program Director of OAHU, Aaron is excited to be connecting marine scientists and researchers across Harvard.","Active_Field_Sites":null,"slug":"aaronhartmann"},"id":"9367e668-98b2-5989-86e6-e64330171e1a"},{"data":{"Name":"Peter Girguis","Research_Keywords":"marine biology, hydrothermal vents, methane, microbes, symbiosis, ROV, submersible, sediments, rocks, physiology","Personal_Keywords":"outreach, diversity, equity, inclusion, early career","Email":"pgirguis@oeb.harvard.edu","Affiliations":"Harvard University, Adjunct Professor at WHOI","ImageAttachment":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#283828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/562b9/PG_Wikipedia.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/3b031/PG_Wikipedia.jpg 63w,\n/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/f726c/PG_Wikipedia.jpg 125w,\n/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/562b9/PG_Wikipedia.jpg 250w,\n/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/27697/PG_Wikipedia.jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/d0437/PG_Wikipedia.webp 63w,\n/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/33105/PG_Wikipedia.webp 125w,\n/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/31860/PG_Wikipedia.webp 250w,\n/static/f3dfec27df735f64348a45cf1265b2f3/d7111/PG_Wikipedia.webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":333}}}]},"Title":"Professor","Website":"https://girguislab.oeb.harvard.edu","Primary_Field":"Biological Sciences","Secondary_Fields":"Microbial Ecology and Physiology, Chemical Oceanography, Applied Ocean Engineering","About":"I was born in California, the son of Egyptian immigrants. I earned my B.Sc. from UCLA, my Ph.D. from the UC Santa Barbara, and was a Packard Postdoctoral Fellow at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute until I joined the department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University in 2005. \n\nMy lab studies the physiological and biochemical adaptations of marine animals and microbes to their environment, with the goal of understanding their role in biogeochemical cycles. We are also interested in symbiosis, from the microbe-animal symbioses at hydrothermal vents to the gut microbiomes of baleen whales. We also develop novel “open-access” instruments such as underwater mass spectrometers and microbial samplers, with the goal of enabling all stakeholders to have access to such tools.\n\nI have the great pleasure of serving on several boards including the Ocean Exploration Trust and the Schmidt Marine Technology Partners. In 2019, I was named a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator for my work in marine symbiosis. I am honored to have been the recipient of the 2007 and 2011 Lindbergh Foundation Award for Science & Sustainability, the 2018 Lowell Thomas Award for groundbreaking advances in Marine Science and Technology, and the 2020 Petra Shattuck Award for Distinguished Teaching. \n\nEqually important, I am devoted to increasing diversity and promoting equity in marine sciences. I am also deeply committed to supporting the arts, and to that end have sponsored artists and writers at sea and have promoted SciArt programs here and abroad. ","Active_Field_Sites":null,"slug":"petergirguis"},"id":"a9afff9e-b521-5113-947d-196469e30b41"},{"data":{"Name":"Zane Wolf","Research_Keywords":"soft robotics, fish, data visualization, neutron star, accretion disk, copepods, pteropods, undulatory locomotion, cherenkov telescope array, cockroach biomechanics\n","Personal_Keywords":"wildlife photography, climbing, coding, snowboarding, outreach, communication","Email":"rzanewolf@gmail.com","Affiliations":"OEB Harvard","ImageAttachment":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#98b8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/f6402/zwolf_profilePic.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/9c45d/zwolf_profilePic.jpg 63w,\n/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/21320/zwolf_profilePic.jpg 125w,\n/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/f6402/zwolf_profilePic.jpg 250w,\n/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/c4004/zwolf_profilePic.jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/c0440/zwolf_profilePic.webp 63w,\n/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/9cc27/zwolf_profilePic.webp 125w,\n/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/e18eb/zwolf_profilePic.webp 250w,\n/static/0320a3ada9a1681c0114cf664cb4ff46/dd525/zwolf_profilePic.webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":339}}}]},"Title":"Graduate Student","Website":null,"Primary_Field":"Biological Sciences","Secondary_Fields":"Biomechanics, Robotics, Fluid Dynamics, Front-end Development","About":"Hi, I am a graduate student in the Lauder Lab at Harvard University.
