I seek to understand the fundamental “rules” of community composition and how human activities are changing these rules in marine ecosystems. I’m particularly interested in the ways that benthic community composition is determined by the interplay of reproductive life histories, dispersal, recruitment, and environmental conditions. I also examine the ways that metabolites evolve in marine organisms and how they shape competitive hierarchies on the seafloor (e.g., secondary metabolites). I received a Ph.D. in Marine Biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California San Diego, an M.S. in Oceanography from SIO, and a B.S. in Biology from the University of Vermont. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and San Diego State University, and I am currently a Lecturer and Researcher in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. As the Program Director of OAHU, Aaron is excited to be connecting marine scientists and researchers across Harvard.","Active_Field_Sites":null,"slug":"aaronhartmann"},"id":"9367e668-98b2-5989-86e6-e64330171e1a"},{"data":{"Name":"Alex Harper","Research_Keywords":null,"Personal_Keywords":null,"Email":"aharper@mbari.org","Affiliations":"MBARI, WHOI","Image_File":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d96b53d382b29ebd302b2f87571040da/8f2b6657/johnnydepp.jpg?ts=1649772813&userId=usrLoEJoQKlop1IG5&cs=7afafd447675c272","thumbnails":{"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/24c0a74145bcaf40e0e90b960f201045/c5fe8ad8?ts=1649772813&userId=usrLoEJoQKlop1IG5&cs=24652bc625fa569e"}}}],"Title":"Program Manager","Website":"https://www.mbari.org/harper-alex/","Primary_Field":"Environmental Sciences","Secondary_Fields":"Chemical Oceanography","About":"Alex earned her PhD in Chemical Oceanography at Florida State University.

He supervises the research and academic program of graduate students studying oceanographic engineering through the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in the areas of control, robotics, and design.  Dr. Yoerger has been a key contributor to the remotely-operated vehicle Jason; to the Autonomous Benthic Explorer known as ABE; most recently, to the autonomous underwater vehicle, Sentry; and the hybrid remotely operated vehicle, Nereus which reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in 2009.  Dr. Yoerger has gone to sea on over 80 oceanographic expeditions exploring the Mid-Ocean Ridge, mapping underwater seamounts and volcanoes, surveying ancient and modern shipwrecks, studying the environmental effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the recent effort that located the Voyage Data Recorder from the merchant vessel El Faro. His current research focuses on robots for exploring the midwater regions of the world's ocean. He heads a team developing a new underwater robot called Mesobot designed to track midwater targets such as zooplankton that play an important role in the movement of carbon through the world’s oceans. He was the 2009 recipient of the Lockheed Award for Ocean Science and Engineering and serves on the Research Board for BP's Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative. He recently served as interim Director of WHOI's Center for Marine Robotics and recently held the Walter A. and Hope Noyes Smith Chair for Excellence in Oceanography. He was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 2021 for the development of autonomous underwater vehicles for deep-ocean exploration and science.","Active_Field_Sites":"Jersey","slug":"danayoeger"},"id":"36cfc0c3-9cfc-5946-bc6c-9c33e9242e3e"},{"data":{"Name":"Dave Matthews","Research_Keywords":"evolution,fish,biomechanics,plasticity,zebrafish","Personal_Keywords":"volleyball,photography,climbing\n","Email":"davethescientist@gmail.com","Affiliations":"Harvard University","Image_File":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d7d0d2de37ac59a2e2d6fe5b153b8962/dbd00642/bell.jpg?ts=1649772813&userId=usrLoEJoQKlop1IG5&cs=f0f3a04f3699cd19","thumbnails":{"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b28df97ee3e32cc8451e2f2384c089fa/2ebd5de0?ts=1649772813&userId=usrLoEJoQKlop1IG5&cs=6f4f99e50f5dec8e"}}}],"Title":"Graduate Student","Website":"http://davethescientist.com/","Primary_Field":"Policy/Economics","Secondary_Fields":"Biomechanic Plasticity","About":"Ph.D. student in George Lauder's lab.

I earned my B.Sc. from UCLA, my Ph.D. from the UC Santa Barbara, and was a Packard Postdoctoral Fellow at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute until I joined the department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University in 2005. \n\nMy lab studies the physiological and biochemical adaptations of marine animals and microbes to their environment, with the goal of understanding their role in biogeochemical cycles. We are also interested in symbiosis, from the microbe-animal symbioses at hydrothermal vents to the gut microbiomes of baleen whales. We also develop novel “open-access” instruments such as underwater mass spectrometers and microbial samplers, with the goal of enabling all stakeholders to have access to such tools.\n\nI have the great pleasure of serving on several boards including the Ocean Exploration Trust and the Schmidt Marine Technology Partners. In 2019, I was named a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator for my work in marine symbiosis. I am honored to have been the recipient of the 2007 and 2011 Lindbergh Foundation Award for Science & Sustainability, the 2018 Lowell Thomas Award for groundbreaking advances in Marine Science and Technology, and the 2020 Petra Shattuck Award for Distinguished Teaching. \n\nEqually important, I am devoted to increasing diversity and promoting equity in marine sciences. I am also deeply committed to supporting the arts, and to that end have sponsored artists and writers at sea and have promoted SciArt programs here and abroad. ","Active_Field_Sites":null,"slug":"petergirguis"},"id":"a9afff9e-b521-5113-947d-196469e30b41"},{"data":{"Name":"Zane Wolfmannn","Research_Keywords":"soft robotics, fish swimming, data visualization","Personal_Keywords":"photography,climbing,coding\n","Email":"rzanewolf@gmail.com","Affiliations":"University of California San Francisco","Image_File":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cdcf645162767c46ee6ef24cc6a1faed/b24fd2de/jackman.jpg?ts=1649772813&userId=usrLoEJoQKlop1IG5&cs=b5cdbd4a34955d4c","thumbnails":{"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/408a00a9c2cfb42b747a9663033ee5a5/2e269d3b?ts=1649772813&userId=usrLoEJoQKlop1IG5&cs=78061d8c40e01ee8"}}}],"Title":"Undergraduate Student","Website":null,"Primary_Field":"Communications","Secondary_Fields":"Biomechanics, Robotics, Fluid Dynamics, Front-end Development","About":null,"Active_Field_Sites":null,"slug":"zanewolfmannn"},"id":"6f7be35f-2031-5acd-adda-e7604f0a0d89"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1121539843","3233389034"]}
