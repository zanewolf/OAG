Current studies include (1) research on a variety of fish robotic models, and (2) investigation of the biomechanics of aquatic locomotion in sharks and ray-finned fishes using quantitative flow visualization. Additional interests include biological fluid mechanics, theoretical approaches to the analysis form and function in organisms, and the history and philosophy of morphology and physiology."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"georgelauder"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3233389034"]}
