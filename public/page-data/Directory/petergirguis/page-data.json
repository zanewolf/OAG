We also study the physiological relationships (such as nutrient exchange and immune responses) between microbes and animals in natural systems. To that end, we apply traditional or modern geochemical and molecular technologies -and develop new technologies- to interrogate physiological and biochemical processes in natural systems or laboratory simulations."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"petergirguis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3233389034"]}
